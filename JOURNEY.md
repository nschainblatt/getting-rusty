## My Journey With Getting Rusy
This file represents the steps I have taken so far learning Rust.

# Week 1:
- 12/23/2023: Read the first three chapters of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), completed all code-alongs, and completed 2/3 exercises at the end of the third chapter (fahrenheit_to_celsius, nth_fibonacci_number).

# Week 2:
- 12/24/2023: Completed the last exercise from the third chapter (twelve_days_of_christmas) and read all of chapter four (will read again to solidify the concept of ownership, references, and slices).
- 12/25/2023: Read chapter four again to get a better grasp of Rust's memory management system. Started reading chapter five which involves structs. A Struct is a type of data structure that groups together variables of different types under a single name. Structs give the programmer the ability to create custom data types to represent a concept in a program.
- 12/26/2023: Read all of chapter five. Learned about structs, usecases of structs, and struct methods otherwise known as associated functions. Uploaded a project named rectangles which shows a lot of the basic use cases of structs.
- 12/27/2023: Worked on a to_do project to practice writing Rust without any guidance. Mostly done, just a few more things to add for this little project before I dive into deeper concepts. This project lets me get used to the syntax and basic flow of rust before moving on. I will try to do mini projects throughout this book on top of the exercises gives to solidify my learning. Once I learn more about Rust I plan on doing DSA problems using Rust as I feel this is an exellent way to learn the language, i've got some more reading on Rust to do first.
