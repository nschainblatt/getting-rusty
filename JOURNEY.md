## My Journey With Getting Rusy
This file represents the steps I have taken so far learning Rust.

# Week 1:
- 12/23/2023: Read the first three chapters of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), completed all code-alongs, and completed 2/3 exercises at the end of the third chapter (fahrenheit_to_celsius, nth_fibonacci_number).

# Week 2:
- 12/24/2023: Completed the last exercise from the third chapter (twelve_days_of_christmas) and read all of chapter four (will read again to solidify the concept of ownership, references, and slices).
- 12/25/2023: Read chapter four again to get a better grasp of Rust's memory management system. Started reading chapter five which involves structs. Structs area type of data structure that group together variables of different types under a single name. A struct is a custom data type to represent a concept in a program.
