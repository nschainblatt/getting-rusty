## My Journey With Getting Rusy
This file represents the steps I have taken so far learning Rust.

# Week 1:
- 12/23/2023: Read the first three chapters of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), completed all code-alongs, and completed 2/3 exercises at the end of the third chapter (fahrenheit_to_celsius, nth_fibonacci_number).

# Week 2:
- 12/24/2023: Completed the last exercise from the third chapter (twelve_days_of_christmas).
