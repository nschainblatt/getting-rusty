# My Journey With Getting Rusty

This file represents the steps I have taken so far in learning Rust.

## Week 1

### 12/23/2023
- Read the first three chapters of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).
- Completed all code-alongs.
- Completed 2/3 exercises at the end of the third chapter (fahrenheit_to_celsius, nth_fibonacci_number).

## Week 2

### 12/24/2023
- Completed the last exercise from the third chapter (twelve_days_of_christmas).
- Read all of chapter four (will read again to solidify the concept of ownership, references, and slices).

### 12/25/2023
- Read chapter four again to get a better grasp of Rust's memory management system.
- Started reading chapter five which involves structs.
  - A Struct is a type of data structure that groups together variables of different types under a single name.
  - Structs give the programmer the ability to create custom data types to represent a concept in a program.

### 12/26/2023
- Read all of chapter five.
- Learned about structs and their use cases.
- Learned about struct methods, otherwise known as associated functions.
- Uploaded a project named rectangles which demonstrates basic use cases of structs.

### 12/27/2023
- Worked on a to_do project to practice writing Rust without any guidance.
- Project is mostly done, just a few more things to add before diving into deeper concepts.
- This project lets me get used to the syntax and basic flow of Rust before moving on.
- I plan on doing mini projects throughout this book on top of the exercises to solidify my learning.
- Once I learn more about Rust, I plan on doing DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms) problems using Rust as I feel this is an excellent way to learn the language.
- I've got some more reading on Rust to do first.
